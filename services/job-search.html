      <p class="content-text">
          Let’s face it. Job hunting can feel like a full-time job. 
      </p>
      <p class="content-text">
          You spend weeks poring through endless job boards, tweaking your resume, and shooting introductory videos over and over again. 
      </p>
      <p class="content-text">
          You even go the extra mile stalking hiring managers on LinkedIn to send cold emails.
      </p>
      <p class="content-text">
          Only to hear…crickets. 
      </p>
      <p class="content-text">
          Or worse, you get interviews, but they never lead to offers.
      </p>
      <p class="content-text">
          It’s frustrating, isn’t it? 
      </p>
      <p class="content-text">
          You’re talented, you’re qualified, and you’re ready to put in the work. But the process feels overwhelming, and, honestly, a little defeating.
      </p>
      <p class="preamble content-text">Maybe you’re wondering:</p>
      <ul class="content-list">
          <li>Am I doing something wrong?</li>
          <li>Is my resume not good enough?</li>
          <li>Why can’t I seem to stand out in a sea of applicants?</li>
          <li>Is job hunting just a game of luck?</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="content-text">
          The truth is, the job market has changed. 
      </p>
      <p class="content-text">
          It’s more competitive than ever, and traditional job search methods just don’t cut it anymore.

          Instead of sending out endless applications and waiting for a response, you have a clear, step-by-step plan.

          You know exactly how to position yourself as the ideal candidate, where to find the best opportunities, and how to connect with decision-makers who want what you bring to the table.

          You need results. 
      </p>
      <p class="content-text">
          You need a plan that doesn’t just tell you what to do, but shows you exactly how to do it.

            <p>
              Job search coaching is a personalized service that helps you navigate the complexities of the job search process with tailored guidance and strategies. Unlike generic advice, job search coaching is centered around your individual goals, challenges, and career aspirations. Here’s how it works:
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Personalized Strategy:</strong> We start by understanding where you are in your career journey, your goals, and your challenges.</li>
                <li><strong>Coaching Sessions:</strong> Through one-on-one sessions, we provide hands-on support to optimize your resume, cover letters, LinkedIn profile, and job applications.</li>
                <li><strong>Ongoing Support:</strong> We guide you through interviews, salary negotiations, and emotional setbacks. You’ll never feel like you’re alone in the process.</li>
                <li><strong>Customized Plan:</strong> Your plan adapts based on progress and shifts in the job market, ensuring you’re always moving toward your desired role.</li>
              </ul>
              By the end of the program, you’ll have not only the tools to find and land your next job but also a strategic advantage in a competitive market.

          <div class="faq__answer">
            <p>
              Free resources often lack personalization, context, and actionable guidance. Here’s why investing in job search coaching is worth it:
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Tailored Guidance:</strong> Free advice can be too general or outdated. Job search coaching is about you—your goals, your industry, and your timeline.</li>
                <li><strong>Accountability:</strong> With free resources, it’s easy to get overwhelmed or distracted. Our program keeps you accountable, ensuring that you stay on track and make consistent progress.</li>
                <li><strong>Expert Insight:</strong> The job market is constantly changing. Free advice doesn’t always reflect the latest trends and technologies (e.g., AI tools, new hiring practices). Our coaching is based on up-to-date strategies that are proven to work in today’s market.</li>
              </ul>
              You get results faster because you’re not guessing or piecing together advice from unreliable sources.

                <li><strong>Industry-Specific Strategies:</strong> Whether you’re in tech, healthcare, finance, or any other field, we adapt the program to focus on strategies that are most relevant to your industry. For example, in tech, we might emphasize portfolio building and coding challenges, while in healthcare, we focus on certifications and patient-centered roles.</li>
                <li><strong>Goal Alignment:</strong> Whether you want to transition industries, secure a promotion, or break into an executive role, we help you create a step-by-step plan that aligns with your specific objectives.</li>
                <li><strong>Ongoing Adaptability:</strong> As the job market evolves or your goals shift, the program adapts. You’ll have constant feedback and adjustments to ensure you’re always on track.</li>

                <li><strong>Flexible Rescheduling:</strong> You can reschedule coaching sessions to fit your schedule, or we can adjust the timeline as needed.</li>

              This program isn’t about quick fixes—it’s about achieving sustainable success. Here’s what you can expect:
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Job Interview Opportunities:</strong> Most users see a significant increase in interview requests within 2-4 weeks of implementing the strategies.</li>
                <li><strong>Offer Letters:</strong> With ongoing coaching, many clients land offers within 2-3 months. This can vary depending on industry, experience level, and commitment to the process.</li>
                <li><strong>Increased Confidence:</strong> You’ll gain clarity on your professional brand and develop the confidence to navigate interviews, salary negotiations, and decision-making.</li>
              </ul>
              While outcomes depend on individual effort, most users start seeing tangible results within a few weeks—with job offers typically following within 90-180 days.

                <li><strong>Google Docs or Word Processing:</strong> For preparing resumes, cover letters, and other job application documents, any word processing tool (like Google Docs or Microsoft Word) will suffice.</li>
                <li><strong>Optional Premium Tools:</strong> While we don’t require extra tools, some clients choose to invest in premium job search platforms or AI tools to streamline the process. These are entirely optional and can be discussed during your sessions if applicable to your job search.</li>
