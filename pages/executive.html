        <p class="content-text">
            The strategies, relationships, and leadership style that once brought you success don’t seem to have the same impact anymore.
        </p>
        <p class="content-text">
            It feels like the ground beneath you is shifting, leaving you questioning if you’re keeping up.

She not only taught me how to think critically, but constantly drove for continous improvement with an eye to the future. She was tough but always fair. She encouraged her employees to find new alternatives to business challenges. She held herself to high standards, set lofty goals and then did everything to reach them. She held her employees to the same high standards and they gladly worked tirelessly to achieve their own goals, all the while receiving encouragement and positive feedback along the way. No detail was too small, no challenge too big and it was truly a pleasure to come into work every day ready for whatever challenge was facing us, knowing we had Dacia's support and leadership.”
